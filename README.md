### Rescale-Invariant-CMFD

Coded by Tejas K

For the first time in the research history of copy move forgery detection(CMFD), we propose an algorithm that can successfully detect copy-rescale-moved forgery.

From the past decade, there were many inventions over the detection of copy move forgery. However, robust detection systems on copy-tamper-move forgeries are yet in the nascent stage. Recognising the research gap, I chose this as my capstone project for my undergraduate studies. 

Logic is well explained in the paper. 

Code is well commented. In the last line of the code, I have manually selected the values among corner1,2,3,4 pixels that form a rectangle that matches the copied region. Hence, change that value as per the need.

There is still a lot of research gap in this field to build one algorithm that could be robust to all kinds of tampering such as rescale, resize, brightness varint, contrast variant, guassian blurring, Different noises such as guassian noise, salt n pepper noise, spectral noise etc. Hence, further research on this would be appreciated. People interested can contact me for further compliance.
